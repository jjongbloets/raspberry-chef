vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

Failed to mount folders in Linux guest. This is usually because
the "vboxsf" file system is not available. Please verify that
the guest additions are properly installed in the guest and
can work properly. The command attempted was:

mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`getent group vagrant | cut -d: -f3` data /data
mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`id -g vagrant` data /data

The error output from the last command was:

stdin: is not a tty
mount: unknown filesystem type 'vboxsf'
